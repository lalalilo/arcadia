excerpt: Redux-saga is a very useful tool to have in a front-end stack. Typing them properly is not obvious though. Here's a guide on how to do it!

# What are sagas

Sagas are functions that return generators:

```ts
function* hello(foo: string) {}
// -> (foo: string) => Generator
```

Even if `redux-saga` relies on other concepts (like effects), typing a saga mostly boils down to typing a generator.

# Typing a generator

Generators typing was improved in [TS 3.6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-6/#stricter-generators).
The current `Generator` type has three type parameters. Some examples will help finding out what they describe.

## Inferred type for a simple generator factory

```ts
function* thisIsAGenerator(foo: boolean) {
  yield "hello world";
  return 0;
}
// -> Generator<string, number, unknown>
```

This example allows us to understand what the first two type arguments stand for in a generator type:

- The first one is the type of the values we yield. We'll call it `YieldType`
- The second one is the type of the generator's return value. We'll call it `ReturnType`

If values of different types are yielded, `YieldType` is the union of each possible type

```ts
function* thisIsYetAnotherGenerator(foo: string) {
  yield "hello world";
  yield ["foo", "bar"];
  return 0;
}
// -> Generator<"hello world" | string[], number, unknown>
```

## Where inferred generator types fall short

Consider this generator:

```ts
function* thisOneIsABitDifferent(foo: string) {
  const bar = yield "baz";
  console.log(bar);
  return 0;
}
// -> Generator<string, number, unknown>
```

Inspecting the type of the bar value turns out to be quite weird.
Indeed, it is of type `any` while it could be expected to be of type `string`.

Having `any` values pop somewhere in TS code is really a pain since it limits a lot the help provided by typing later in the function.
Why can't TS infer the type of `bar` automatically?

To understand it, it is necessary to dig a bit deeper in generator behaviour.

Let's consider this code from [the TS 3.6 release blogpost](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-6/#stricter-generators):

```ts
function* counter() {
  let i = 0;
  while (true) {
    const stop = yield i++;
    if (stop) {
      break;
    }
  }
  return "done!";
}
```

What is the type of `stop` here? If your answer is `number`, you're wrong.

Actually, `stop` could a boolean, a string, an object. From all we know according to this code, it could be of _any_ type. It depends on how the generator is used.

## The `yield` keyword

Let's refer to [`yield`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/yield)'s documentation:

> The yield keyword is used to pause and resume a generator function.

The yielded value defines the new current value of the generator. It can be seen in the example they provide:

```ts
function* foo(index) {
  while (index < 2) {
    yield index++;
  }
}

const iterator = foo(0);

console.log(iterator.next().value);
// expected output: 0

console.log(iterator.next().value);
// expected output: 1
```

What is the stored value when the result of the `yield` operator is saved then? **The saved value actually is the argument provided to the `iterator.next` function.**

Using the previously defined `counter` generator:

```ts
const iter = counter();
let curr = iter.next();
while (!curr.done) {
  console.log(curr.value);
  curr = iter.next(curr.value === 5);
}
console.log(curr.value.toUpperCase());

// prints:
//
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
// done!
```

Here, `next` is called with a boolean value (`curr.value === 5`). Which means `stop` in the definition of `counter` is of type `boolean`.

Knowing how a generator is used is necessary to know what type `yield` operations return.

## The full typing of a generator

It is now possible to fully type a generator:

```ts
function* counter(): Generator<number, "done!", boolean>;
```

- `counter` successive values are numbers
- `counter` returns `"done!"` when there are no new values to generate
- `counter` takes boolean values as an argument to generate new values

This example will not compile since there's a conflict on the type of `bar`:

```ts
function* thisIsAWrongSaga(foo: string): Generator<string, number, boolean> {
  const bar: string = yield "baz";
  // Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string'.
  console.log(bar);
  return 0;
}
```

# Typing a saga

Everything up to this point works for any kind of generator factory. However, `redux-sagas` is not limited to writing generator factories.
The library does all the heavy lifting related to orchestrating the sagas (i.e. running effects and calling `next`).

## Using `StrictEffect`

Sagas introduce the concept of [effects](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/basics/DeclarativeEffects.html).
Here is the inferred type for a saga that uses the `delay` effect:

```ts
function* thisIsASaga(foo: string) {
  yield delay(1000);
  return 0;
}
// -> Generator<SimpleEffect<"CALL", CallEffectDescriptor<true>>, number, unknown>
```

Here's a quick look at `@types/redux-saga`'s definition of a `SimpleEffect`:

```ts
export interface Effect<T = any, P = any> {
  "@@redux-saga/IO": true;
  combinator: boolean;
  type: T;
  payload: P;
}

export interface SimpleEffect<T, P = any> extends Effect<T, P> {
  combinator: false;
}
```

`redux-saga` basically yields simple objects describing what actions should be done without actually doing them.

That's why sagas are supposed to be easily testable.
Limiting saga yields to effects (including `call` effects) allows to test values that do not depend on the implementation of external functions.

`@types/redux-saga` provides a `StrictEffect` type that can be used in generator types to allow nothing but effects in yields:

```ts
const wiiiiiiiiii = () => "hihihihihi";
function* thisIsAWrongSaga(foo: string): Generator<StrictEffect, number, any> {
  yield wiiiiiiiiii();
  // Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'StrictEffect<any, any>'.
  return 0;
}
```

## Handling forks

Some effects are supposed to return specific values. See [`fork`](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/api/)'s documentation for instance:

> The result of yield fork(fn ...args) is a Task object. An object with some useful methods and properties.

Knowing how to type a generator, this is now easy to handle:

```ts
function* thisIsASagaThatForks(
  foo: string
): Generator<StrictEffect, number, Task> {
  const potato = yield fork(function*() {
    yield "Bepis";
  });
  cancel(potato);

  return 0;
}
```

# Limitation of this typing process

This way of typing comes with a few constraints.
One of them is the handling of different yield return types.

```ts
const createPotato = () => "potato";
const createTomato = () => false;

export function* thisYieldsManyStuff(): Generator<
  StrictEffect,
  string,
  string | boolean
> {
  const potato = yield call(createPotato);
  const tomato = yield call(createTomato);
  return "yay!";
}
```

`potato` and `tomato` will both have the same type which is `string | boolean` .

Splitting sagas in smaller bits should allow to overcome this issue in most cases.

## The `yield*` operator

This is `yield*`'s defintion:

> The `yield*` expression is used to delegate to another generator or iterable object.

This operator allows to chain generators. An added bonus is that it provides a good typing of the result value:

```ts
function* secondaryGenerator() {
  yield delay(1000);
  return true;
}
// -> Generator<SimpleEffect<"CALL", CallEffectDescriptor<true>>, boolean, unknown>

function* mainGenerator(): Generator<StrictEffect, void, string> {
  const foo = yield call(wiiiiiiiiii); // string
  const secondaryGeneratorResult = yield* secondaryGenerator(); // boolean
  console.log(secondaryGeneratorResult);
}
```

Combining this with proper saga splitting should allow you to get a perfect typing every single time!

# Practice !

[Here](https://codesandbox.io/s/adoring-mayer-umr13) is a small typescript sandbox with some of the examples given in this article.
Playing with it may help better understanding how all of this. As with a lot of things, practice makes perfect!
