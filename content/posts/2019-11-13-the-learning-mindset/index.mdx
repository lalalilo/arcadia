## A trust contract

You joined Lalilo? Congratulation. It means we, the people you saw during your interviews, trust you. We have no doubt about your capabilities and skills. We have no doubt you will be a huge asset to Lalilo and that Lalilo will make you grow up.

And because there is a strong trust relationship between all members of Lalilo, by transitivity, it is the complete Lalilo team that trusts you.

I mean it. All the people around you at Lalilo really trust that you are the right person at the right place. And we are not naive: we know that everybody fails at some point. We know you don't know everything. Actually, you just know a little as we do. **And this is fine.** We hired you knowing this. We take you as you are and we are excited to see you grow with us! Be confident in yourself.

In return, we ask you to trust the team. At Lalilo you will be challenged. These challenges are benevolent. They aim to make you grow up and this will make Lalilo grow up because you are part of Lalilo. Trust the team to be benevolent and be happy that the team is demanding.

Some feedbacks might be tough. It does not mean they are not benevolent. I remember some tough moments in my childhood where my parents told me things quite straightforward. As a dad, I know Today how benevolent it was and that I grew up a lot from these moments. It does not mean your manager is like your dad or mum and that you are a kid and that challenges must be tough. It just means that behind a tough challenge can be hidden a benevolent challenge.

## Embrace feedback

Giving improvement feedback is hard. Every Human Being wants to be liked, it is part of human nature. Thus, explaining to someone he or she could improve is an uncomfortable situation because challenged people easily adopt a defensive position.

In your personal life, you will always get feedback from your friends. This is because it is more important for them to help you than the picture you might have of them. Have you ever met some random people in the street telling you that your fly is open?

It is important to encourage your challengers to continue giving feedback. Thank them for the feedback. Remember that it is not easy for them to do it.

This being said, I mostly try to catch someone doing something right. It is important to know when you do things well.

## Embrace problems

We love problems. They are opportunities to learn. They force us to ask ourselves "What are we doing wrong"? The fact that we love problems does not mean we trigger them. However, we consider them very seriously to make sure we get the most knowledge out of them.

In many companies, problems are hidden to avoid to be told off or even fired. At Lalilo you could be fired to hide a problem but never to show a problem. We actually know that problems are part of your job. We expect you to have problems. We need you to be willing to learn from it and you will always find help to do so. The first step is to make it visible.

## Remember you know a little

My former CTO used to tell me to read books, at least to observe how vast is the knowledge and remember that I only know a little. This humility position is key to learn. Don't be afraid of this. It is actually very good news. It means we can never stop to grow up.

These points are key to Lalilo culture. They are shared here for outsiders curious about what it looks like to work at Lalilo but also for the Lalilo team to remember what we stand for.
