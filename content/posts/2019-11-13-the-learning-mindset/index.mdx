## A trust contract

When you join Lalilo, it means we, the people you saw during your interviews, trust you. We have no doubt about your capabilities and skills. We have no doubt you will be a huge asset to Lalilo and that Lalilo will make you grow up.

And because there is a strong trust relationship between all members of Lalilo, by transitivity, it is the complete Lalilo team that trusts you.

I mean it. All the people around you at Lalilo truly trust that you are the right person at the right place. And we are not naive: we know that everybody fails at some point. We know you don't know everything. Actually, you just know as little as we do. **And this is fine.** We hired you knowing this. We take you as you are and we are excited to see you grow with us! Be confident in yourself.

In return, we ask you to trust the team. It is part of the job of every Lalilian to relevantly and benevolently challenge the rest of the team. You have to consider these challenges. It will make you grow up and this will make Lalilo grow up because you are part of Lalilo. Be demanding with your teammates. They will also be demanding with you so that everybody grow up.

## Embrace feedback

Giving improvement feedback is hard. Every Human Being wants to be liked, it is part of human nature. Thus, explaining to someone he or she could improve is an uncomfortable situation because challenged people easily adopt a defensive position.

In your personal life, when you get feedback it always comes from your friends or family. This is because they are the only ones who care more about you than what you think about them. Have you ever met some random people in the street telling you that your fly is open?

It is important to encourage your challengers to continue giving feedback. Thank them for the feedback. Remember that it is not easy for them to do it.

This being said, we mostly try to catch someone doing something right. It is important to know when you do things well.

## Embrace problems

We love problems. They are an opportunity to learn. They force us to ask ourselves "What are we doing wrong"? The fact that we love problems does not mean we trigger them. However, we consider them very seriously to make sure we get the most knowledge out of them.

In many companies, problems are hidden to avoid to be told off or even fired. At Lalilo we would be much more annoyed that you hide problems than than you spot them. We actually know that problems are part of your job. We expect you to have problems. We need you to be willing to learn from it and you will always find help to do so. The first step is to make it visible.

## Remember you know little

My former CTO used to tell me to read books, at least to observe how vast knowledge is and remember that I only know little. This humility position is key to learn. Don't be afraid of this. It is actually very good news. It means we can never stop to grow up.

These points are key to Lalilo culture. They are shared here for outsiders curious about what it looks like to work at Lalilo but also for the Lalilo team to remember what we stand for.
